  <h1>About the DM</h1>
  <p>Hi, My name is Ben but most people I talk to know me as Ghoul. I’ve been working unpaid for the past year in creating home-brew for Dungeons and Dragons campaigns including making races, classes and other types of things.</p>
  <p>For a while I have been helping Dungeon Masters and players get to grips with DND and have even created many tutorials teaching people how to get started. During this blog I will be republishing these tutorials and trying to expand my reader variations.</p>
  <p>I am also working with many Dungeon Masters to create the largest DND campaign which is still in production. With help from my friends we have created a community of players with over 6,000 people active on a daily basis.</p>
  <p>In order to tell you about myself I’m going to share my favourite moments and characters from Dungeons of Dragons. The best way I feel like I can do this is tell you about my Used Characters and to share their character sheets (feel free to use them but beware that if you do, they aren’t your characters so you wont feel attached to the character which is part of the reason why a lot of people love DND.</p>
