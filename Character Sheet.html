  <h1>Character Sheets</h1>
  <p>Character sheets are one of if no the most important piece of kit a DND player will need. No matter what everyone needs one. Character sheets are used to not down everything about your character from modifiers to equipment. All of which are important for everyone to have and understand.</p>
  <p>Here are two videos that are made by WASD20 who is known for making guides and tutorials for lots of different things:</p>
  <p>This first video was made to teach how to make a melee based character which will be easier to learn for a new player in dungeons and dragons.</p>

  <p>This second video was made to teach how to make a spellcaster which can be more difficult for a new dungeons and dragons player.</p>

  </iframe>

  <p>In these guides WASD20 uses the official template for character sheets and makes a rogue and a wizard although there are many classes (official and unofficial) that can be used. If you are looking for the guides (but dont want to pay) you can be roguish and use <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://thetrove.is/Books/Dungeons%20%26%20Dragons%20%5Bmulti%5D/5th%20Edition%20%285e%29/Core/" target="_blank">The Trove</a> for the guides and modules that have been released for 5th Edition. You can however look up everything online and there are many different sites that can be used to do this.</p>
  <p>I do not recommend using DND beyond because most of the content (including the basic player handbook content) is locked behind a paywall so you wont be able to customise your characters to the point you want to.</p>
  <p>I also dont recommend using other people’s character sheets as it not as fun to play a campaign when you have not made the character. If you haven’t made it yourself, often you can find yourself unfulfilled in the end of the campaign. It’s certainly more fun to put the work in and make your own.</p>
